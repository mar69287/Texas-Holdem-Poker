      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <p>
        The goal of a Texas hold'em game is to use your hole cards in
        combination with the community cards to make the best possible five-card
        poker hand.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In a game of Texas hold'em, each player is dealt two cards face down
          (the 'hole cards')
        </li>
        <li>
          Over several betting rounds, five more cards are (eventually) dealt
          face up in the middle of the table
        </li>
        <li>
          These face-up cards are called the 'community cards.' Each player is
          free to use the community cards in combination with their hole cards
          to build a five-card poker hand.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Your mission is to construct your five-card poker hands using the best
        available five cards out of the seven total cards (your two hole cards
        and the five community cards).
      </p>
